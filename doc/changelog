didjvu (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make ‘didjvu --help’ print also Gamera version number.
  * Try loading images with Gamera, and only fall back to Python Imaging
    Library. This should be both faster and allow to load wider variety of
    TIFF images.
  * Check Python version in setup.py.
  * Let the setup.py script build the manual page.
  * Disable the Gatos et. al thresholding algorithm for the time being, as it
    didn't work anyway.
  * Optimize Gamera → PIL conversions.
  * Prevent Numpy from being imported by Gamera (loading it takes noticeable
    amount of time, even though it's never needed).
  * Remove LANGUAGE variable from environment when calling external processes.
  * Correct error message about writing binary data to a terminal.
  * Add support for the “shading subtraction” algorithm.
  * Allow (and prefer) hyphens instead of underscores in method names.
